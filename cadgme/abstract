Ja, Portugal ist mir nicht zu weit, um dort in einem Vortrag CindyGL vorzustellen. Ich finde es spannend, auch mal in einem Education-Kontext über CindyGL zu sprechen.

Der Workshop wäre ja "Mathematics Education for Students in Upper Secondary School and University First Grade using Cabri and Cinderella"?

Als Erstentwurf für den Abstract schlage ich Folgendes vor:


Title: GPU Accelerated Visualizations in Education.

We present an approach to integrate graphical shaders into dynamic geometry software in order to enhance mathematics education. We have developed the plugin CindyGL for CindyJS, which translates the Cinderella inherent high-level programming language CindyScript into shader code. Shader code is then automatically used to accelerate content on the GPU via WebGL.
With this tool, we provide a natural workflow to generate GPU-accelerated applets. In contrast to conventional shader programming techniques, the programmer seamlessly integrates the shader program into a scripting language. This integration makes CindyGL readily usable for both instructors and students without preceding experience in shader programming and thereby leverages the first steps in shader programming.
Furthermore, a wide range of interactive, GPU-accelerated teaching material can be generated by CindyGL. It can be examined on most portable modern devices, since CindyGL uses commonly available WebGL. In the session we are going to show some CindyGL-supported teaching material for upper secondary school and university that demands GPU-acceleration:
- Real-time interference of waves.
- Instant phase portraits of complex functions.
- Visualizations of the convergence discs of Taylor series.
- Rendering implicitly defined functions in three dimensions.
- Interactive visualizations of three-dimensional concepts such as the stereographic projection.
- Mathematical processing of live footage.
